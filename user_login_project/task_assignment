1. Create a new project, using rails new user_login_project
2. Create a new model called 'User' with the information above.
Rails will automatically create the automatic increment of the primary field called ID as well as created_at and updated_at time stamps.
    User.create(first_name:"", last_name:"", email_address:"", age:any_number)
3. Create a few records in the users table using the Rails console.
Now add validations to the model so that...
    it requires the presence of all four fields.
    it requires the age to be numeric.
    it requires the first_name and the last_name to be at least 2 characters each.
    it requires the age to be at least 10 and below 150 (look into http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveModel/Validations/HelperMethods/validates_numericality_of for some help).
Get familiar with .save, .valid?
    user = User.new
    user.first_name:""
    user.last_name:""
    user.email_address:""
    user.age:integer
    user.save
    
4. use .errors and .errors.full_messages so that you can see/display the error messages when the validations are failing
    user = User.create(first_name:"Kenny", last_name:"Pham", email_address:"kenny@pham.com", age:200)
    user.valid? => false
    user.errors.full_messages => "Age must be less than 150"

6. Using the Rails console...
    a. See if it allows you to insert some records when the fields are not meeting the validation rules we set (e.g. try to create a record where age is 5 or above 150, or where the first name is just one character, etc).
    b. Make sure your console returns appropriate error messages when you try to save something that's not meeting the validation rules.
    c. Know how to retrieve all users.
        User.all
    d. Know how to get the first user.
        User.first
    e. Know how to get the last user.
        User.last
    f. Know how to get the users sorted by their first name (order by first_name DESC).
        User.order("first_name DESC")
    g. See ordering rules and more here: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#ordering
    h. Get the record of the user whose id is 3 and UPDATE the person's last_name to something else. Know how to do this directly in the console using .find and .save.
        user = User.find(3)
        user.last_name="Oxone"
        user.save
    i. Know how to delete a record of a user whose id is 4 (use something like User.find(2).destroy...).
        User.find(3).destroy
